# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help

yarn hardhat run scripts/sample-script.ts --network localhost
yarn hardhat run scripts/sample-script.ts --network sepolia
yarn hardhat run scripts/sample-script.ts --network matic
yarn hardhat coverage
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat clean
```
